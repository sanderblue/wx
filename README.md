![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/sanderblue/wx/Build%20and%20deploy)

This monorepo (powered by [Nx](https://nx.dev/)) contains a few small applications - a small cron job app, a frontend app, and a backend app. It's currently biased towards winter weather, specifically snow depth data for mountains in the [Cascade Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range) in the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).

#### About the project

Weather is fascinating, and since I'm mildly obsessed with snow, I decided to start there when it came to preliminary features. The project started out as an experiment to see how well [Nx workspaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVKMse-gFBI) can handle building multiple applications with different frameworks within a single repository. So far it's worked out quite well. This particular Nx workspace contains a frontend app built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and two backend apps built with [Nest](https://nestjs.com/).
